# workaholics-bane
An extension built for CS50's final project that will stop the user from visiting any websites after a specified time, forcing them to take a break from their work or to disconnect.
Upon completion, this extension will have 
<ul>
<li>a popup showing the time left in a working session</li>
<li>an options page allowing users to set the end time for their working session</li>
<li>the ability to add whitelisted sites through the options page</li>
<li>the ability to disable the extension for a certain time period through the options page</li>
</ul>
